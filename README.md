### Description

To be used with the PC game Soldier of Fortune 2 - Double Helix.

This program lets the user play 64+ new radio messages in-game. Readme explains the rest. You need SoF2 in order to use this. I don't know how many of PSC's users play games, but I thought what the heck, I'll submit this prog that I made for the SoF2 community just in case anyone wanted the source.
 
### More Info
 
that you have sof2 installed :)

if you have sof2 installed, it will copy the new pk3 file to your sof2 directory.
